                friends who fought at Gallipoli. Your grandfather was the only survivor, and he kept a memento
                from each member of the group. Among these mementos is a diary, from which you learn that each
                of member of the group was from a different battalion, had a different rank, and that each of them
                died in a different way and in a different part of Gallipoli. Using clues from the diary and
                mementos, you hope to recreate the harrowing experiences faced by your grandfather and his
                friends.</p><h2>Print n Play files</h2><p><a href="/content/lest-we-forget-rulebook.pdf">Rulebook (pdf)</a></p><p><a href="/content/lest-we-forget-pnp.pdf">Cards (pdf)</a></p></div></body></html>
