Whale Postal Service and Heron Deliveries are locked in a battle to
                become the most trusted mail service in the Seven Islands. To come out on top, you'll
                need to plan efficient routes between the islands, get help from the islands' eccentric
                inhabitants, and be EXTRA careful with the strange Fragile packages you'll be carrying!</p><p>Island Delivery is a pick up and deliver game: players move between the islands to
                pick up packages and deliver them to their destinations. Each player's character moves
                differently: the whale can only move clockwise, and the heron is restricted by the height
                of the islands. Delivering packages earns players reputation: you can win by having the
                most reputation at the end of the game, or immediately if you get a large enough lead!
                This tug-of-war ensures every game is full of tension.</p><p>The game starts out pretty simple, but as packages are delivered, new unique Island
                Actions become available (giving players more options), and Fragile packages are introduced
                that give greater rewards, but have special requirements making them harder to deliver!
                In this way, the complexity and decision space opens up over the course of the game
                without being frontloaded, leading to a really great arc every time.</p><p>The charming aesthetic of Island Delivery has been a hit with playtesters - they
                immediately latch onto the theme of the game, which has been carefully designed to
                reinforce the mechanics as well as provide a hook to get people interested. I believe
                that great professional art could really elevate this aspect of the game and make it
                something really special.</p><h2>Print n Play files</h2><p><a href="/content/island-delivery-sellsheet.png">Sellsheet (png)</a></p><p><a href="/content/island-delivery-rulebook.pdf">Rulebook (pdf)</a></p><p><a href="/content/island-delivery-pnp.pdf">Cards (pdf)</a></p></div></body></html>
