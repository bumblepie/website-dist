                You've been reading scary articles online about the Thesian Werewolf Parasite - apparently it slowly
                turns people into wolves, replacing them one bit at a time so no-one will notice! You've got the
                strangest feeling your Grandma might be infected, but she never wants to be a bother. You'll need to
                work hard to convince her to see the doctor - you'll need some proof that something's off! But there's
                always the chance that you're wrong, and you don't want to damage your relationship with her. You'll
                need to be careful, watch for any suspicious changes and trust your instincts to make sure that
                Grandma's OK!</p><p>In Grandma of Theseus, one player plays as the Thesian Werewolf Parasite, trying to take over
                Grandma's body without being caught. The other player plays as Red Riding Hood, watching Grandma
                closely for signs of the parasite and trying to keep her safe.</p><p>A 9 card bluffing game made for the Button Shy 9 card challenge January/Feb 2022.</p><h2>Print n Play files</h2><p><a href="/content/GrandmaOfTheseus.pdf">GrandmaOfTheseus.pdf</a></p></div></body></html>
