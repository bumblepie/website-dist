                rambunctious revelry. Each guest is assigned a seat according to their station in life, but once the party
                begins the veneer of formality wears off, and for this one evening nobility and peasantry alike are
                mixed together. The night’s festivities are suddenly cut short as a fortune teller, seemingly in a trance,
                points at the King. “You shall die tonight, at the hands of your least favoured guest!” The party
                immediately descends into panic and chaos. To sort out this mess, you’ll need to restore order, getting
                everyone back to their assigned place in the seating order while avoiding the assassin’s blade!</p><p>The goal in The King’s Feast is get each guest back to their assigned place in the seating arrangement
                without giving the assassin a chance to kill the King. You do this by activating cards’ special effects to
                flip and swap them, trying to get them closer to their assigned place over time. If you ever use a card’s
                effect to flip the assassin card face up or peek at it, the assassin uses the confusion of the feast as cover
                to kill the king, ending the game immediately.</p><p>A solo puzzle game created for the Button Shy 18 Card Numbers Challenge April 2022.</p><h2>Print n Play files</h2><p><a href="/content/the-kings-feast-rulebook.pdf">the-kings-feast-rulebook.pdf</a></p><p><a href="/content/the-kings-feast-pnp.pdf">the-kings-feast-pnp.pdf</a></p></div></body></html>
