Rather than do them yourselves, you chose to summon imps to do the chores for you! Some time later, you hear footsteps ascending the tower stairway - your master is back and there's going to be hell to pay if he finds out about the imps! There's not enough time to get rid of all of them - one of you is going to get caught. So begins the Summoning Circle Scramble: a battle of wits in which you manipulate the de-summoning ritual so that your imps are de-summoned before those of your opponent!</p><p>An 18 card worker placement game made for the Button Shy 18 card challenge June/July 2020.</p><h2>Print n Play files</h2><p><a href="/content/SCS-Rulebook.pdf">SCS-Rulebook.pdf</a></p><p><a href="/content/SCS-PnP.pdf">SCS-PnP.pdf</a></p></div></body></html>
